<h3>September 8th of 2017</h3>
  <p class="container">The Goal of the <a id="link" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173362530/#editor">Scratch</a> project was to make a game that has multiple levels that gets progressivly harder every time. Our game is called ping pong; this is a two player game. We made a design <a id="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jdSmpikCGNtbrb5yyafFjqLwYrnfryaFVrb0Iy9ZRw4/edit">notebook</a> that kept all of our ideas and comments so that we can use them later to make our game better. There is a timer and when the time gets to a certain time the ball goes really fast. Me and my partner worked together and we had many ideas and we both participated in this project. We some problems but we were able to fix them all; our main problem was that the ball sometimes would glitch when it hit the paddle. This project made me closer to my partner and it also taught me new things about coding. </p>
