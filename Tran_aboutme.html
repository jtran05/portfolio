           <p>  I am a Freshman at Dublin High and I like to do many activities like Playing video games, riding my bike, or playing my favorite sport Badminton. My career goal is to go to college and become a compurter engineer. My other minor goals are to Learn code and become better at it, and I also want to get better a badminton and maybe getting on a team. I made this my goal because I loved to play badminton and I always strived to get better; when I heard about computer science I thought it was cool so I wanted to try it out one day.</p>
         <p>I have participated in many school activities and done many things. I usually participate in most of the school activities and going to games or plays. I like to go out with some of my friends and we do some activity. Sometimes I go to the a badminton gym so I can practice and most of the time I have friends who also like the sport and come play with me. We play in teams and we try to work on our teamwork and get better. I am very committed to playing to badminton that I joined the team. I also liked to code sometimes maybe on MIT appinventor. When I was a kid I always liked to play apps and I always wondered how they make the games ,so I was always interested in coding. </p>
         <p>I want to get better at coding and Badminton. Badminton and coding are kind of similar; they both are very challenging and you must improve to get better. In code if you mess up then your whole code wonâ€™t work just like in badminton you could get injured and can mess up your whole career.  My life has has been full of adventures and hope there will be more in the future. That all about me and thank you your reading my story and check out all my other stuff.</p>
